# Resonance Detector
# Looks for points on the Smith Chart where the market is highly resonant or dissonant.
resonance_detector:
  # "Open Circuit" resonance: Trend is extremely strong, cycle is negligible.
  # Corresponds to the far right of the chart. Potential for trend exhaustion.
  open_circuit_threshold: 10.0 # Impedance > 10

  # "Short Circuit" resonance: Cycle is extremely strong, trend is negligible.
  # Corresponds to the far left of the chart. Potential for sharp reversals.
  short_circuit_threshold: 0.1 # Impedance < 0.1

  # "Matched Load": Trend and cycle are perfectly balanced.
  # Corresponds to the center of the chart. Potential for stable, continuing trend.
  matched_load_tolerance: 0.1 # abs(Impedance - 1.0) < 0.1

# Signal Generation
# Defines how Smith Chart events are translated into trading signals.
